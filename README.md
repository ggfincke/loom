# Loom — Resume Tailoring Tool

A Python-based tool that uses the OpenAI API to tailor resumes to job descriptions.

## Installation

### 1. Create Conda Environment
```bash
conda create -n loom python=3.12
conda activate loom
```

### 2. Install Dependencies and CLI Tool
```bash

```

After installation, you can use the `loom` command from anywhere in your terminal.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```

## Usage

Loom provides two main commands for resume tailoring:

### Sectionize Command

Parse a resume (.docx) into structured sections:

```bash
loom sectionize path/to/resume.docx --out-json sections.json
```

This command:
- Analyzes your resume document
- Identifies and categorizes different sections (e.g., Summary, Experience, Skills)
- Outputs structured section data to a JSON file

### Tailor Command

Generate targeted edits for your resume based on a job description:

```bash
loom tailer job_description.txt path/to/resume.docx --sections-path sections.json --out-json edits.json
```

This command:
- Takes a job description text file as input
- Analyzes your resume sections (from the sectionize output)
- Generates line-by-line edits to tailor your resume
- Outputs surgical editing instructions to optimize your resume for the specific job
