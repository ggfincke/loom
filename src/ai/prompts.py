# Shared LaTeX policy for .tex file editing
LATEX_EDITING_POLICY = r"""
LaTeX-specific rules (when editing .tex files):

Special Character Escaping:
- Escape special characters: & → \&, % → \%, # → \#, _ → \_, $ → \$
- For tilde: use \textasciitilde{} or \~{}
- For literal braces: use \{ and \}
- For carets: use \textasciicircum{} or \^{} in text mode

List Environment Rules:
- CRITICAL: NEVER use \item outside of list environments (\begin{itemize} or \begin{enumerate})
- Project/experience descriptions should remain as plain text, not list items
- Check list environment boundaries before using \item
- Maintain proper nesting of list environments
- Use custom list environments if defined (e.g., tightitemize)
- Only use \item when the line is already inside a list environment

Spacing and Line Breaks:
- Use \\\\ only in valid contexts (tables, center, paragraphs)
- NEVER use \\\\ at the end of a standalone line
- Use \hfill for right alignment, not manual spaces
- Preserve \\  (backslash-space) for manual spacing
- Use \vspace{} and \noindent appropriately

Environment and Command Integrity:
- Always match \begin{env} with \end{env}
- Preserve custom commands (e.g., \name{}, \sectionhead{}, \role{})
- Don't modify preamble commands (\usepackage, \newcommand)
- Keep LaTeX comments (%) intact

Text Formatting:
- Use LaTeX quotes: `` for open quotes, '' for close quotes (not straight quotes)
- Use \textbar or | for vertical bars, not plain pipes
- Use --- for em-dash, -- for en-dash, not plain hyphens
- Preserve \textbf{}, \emph{}, \textit{} formatting

URL and Link Handling:
- Keep \href{}{} commands intact with proper escaping
- Don't break hyperref links by adding invalid characters

Document Structure:
- Don't modify \documentclass, \usepackage, or preamble
- Preserve section hierarchy (\section, \subsection)
- Keep custom section commands if defined
- If a line is plain text (not in a list), keep it as plain text even when enhancing it

# Multi-line validation rule
MULTI_LINE_VALIDATION = (
    "CRITICAL VALIDATION: replace_line.text MUST NOT contain \\n characters. "

OPERATION_ORDERING = (
    "Sort operations by increasing line number. Ensure ranges don't overlap. "
    "Edits must be idempotent and non-conflicting."
